Movies have made a bigger impact on my choice to pursue data science than might be wise to admit, with movies like *Moneyball* and documentaries like *AlphaGo*. 

The idea that we could completely demystify things that we used to consider the realm of "human intuition," beyond numbers and analysis, was fascinating and alluring to me. It seemed like humans, either through lack of imagination, fear, or vanity, didn't want to believe that people and our behavior could be distilled down to a number which could allow math, machines, robots to do them better than we had been doing. But those movies inspired me to read more about the power of data and how it was used to assemble a competitive roster, or defeat a top ranked professional Go player in a supposedly "unsolvable" game. The power of data was undeniable. 

Since then I've dabbled a bit into data and data analysis on my own. I tracked election results and campaign spending data to see if a strong relationship existed there. I gathered and analyzed NHL drafting data to see how much "skill" there was in teams' drafting departments. In both cases the data contradicted some commonly held wisdom. It's a common belief that the more money you spend in a campaign that the more likely you are to win, especially if you're outspending your opponent. But at least for the 2010, 2014, 2016 election cycle, that wasn't true. During this little side project I actually learned that this is a phenomenon that isn't unknown to political scientists. The incumbents that spend more in their contested races are the ones feeling more vulnerable who feel money can give them the edge. They feel more vulnerable because they feel their re-election chances are weak. The weaker they feel, the more they attempt to counter it by spending. 

People also assume that since NHL scouts are paid professionals with years of experience watching and evaluating hockey talent that they must know *something.* But once I gathered the data, outside of the consensus picks in the top third of the first round, very few players actually pan out. Fewer than 50% of players drafted past the 1st round even play a full season in the NHL. Significantly less than that are players who will make significant impacts on their teams. Over the 10+ years I evaluated together, the gap between teams picking "impact players" was pretty neglibile. The best drafting team picked up just a few more star players than the worst teams. When considering that teams made dozens and dozens of picks over those years, a gap of a few players between the best and worst scouting departments appears more like random chance than skill. 

In both these cases I saw a fuller dataset and fuller understanding of the data to be eye-opening, encouraging, and cause for optimism. I would hope voters would be optimistic that money isn't as important to winning an election as many seem to believe. I would hope that NHL teams that see how poorly every team really drafts can see room for improvement in embracing more objective forms of scouting, over a reliance on the "eye test." 

I took that more broadly. I want to be better at gathering and analyzing data. That is why I enrolled in the Data Science program.
